# NYC Citi Bike Analysis

## Overview

After being inspired by the Citi Bike program in NYC, we are interested in creating a similar bikesharing program in Des Moines, IA. To begin our analysis, we will use data from NYC to learn how the program works there. 

We have a CSV file with all August 2019 Citi Bike data. It includes a record of 2,344,224 total trips. It's good for looking at summertime trends, but less useful helping us predict winter riding behavior.
