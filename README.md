# **NYC Citi Bike Analysis**

## *Overview*

After being inspired by the Citi Bike program in NYC, we are interested in creating a similar bikesharing program in Des Moines, IA. To begin our analysis, we will use data from NYC to learn how the program works there. 

We have a CSV file with all August 2019 Citi Bike data. It includes a record of 2,344,224 total trips. It's good for looking at summertime trends, but less useful helping us predict winter riding behavior.

## *Results*

Link to [Tableau Story] (https://public.tableau.com/views/NYCCitibike_16417158579650/citibikeStory?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

Using the data from the CSV, there are 8 visualizations in the Tableau story:

	- Top Starting Locations
		* Starting locations are concentrated in Manhattan, especially in the Upper West Side and down to Soho.

	- Top Ending Locations
		* Ending locations are similar to starting locations, so the bikes are not moving too far from where they are 		needed for a new rider

	- Peak Hours, August
		* Busiest hours are 8:00am and 6:00pm, so it's likely that many are using the bikes to commute to and from work.
	- Trips by Weekday per Hour
		* Like the peak hour visualization, this heat map shows heavy use during weekday rush hour commute. At the same time, it reflects different behavior on Saturday/Sunday, with the most rides from 10:00am to 1:00pm.

	- Trips by Gender, Weekday per Hour
